## Build and Test

```

## Run

Before running the program, you must store a [Warhorn API access token](https://warhorn.net/developers/docs/guides/access-tokens) in the `WARHORN_API_TOKEN` environment variable.

The command line arguments are as follows:

1. `slug`: the unique identifier for the event (found in Warhorn event page URLs)
2. `email`: the email address of the user whose registration you want to find

Note that the app is actually run by Gradle. It requires you to wrap this program's command line arguments in an `--args` command line argument of its own. Also note that you need to wrap this program's arguments in double quotes. See the example below.

```sh
$ export WARHORN_API_TOKEN=<your API token>
$ ./gradlew run --args "bionic-dwarf test@example.com"

> Task :app:run
âœ… Found an active, cleared registration for test@example.com at Bionic Dwarf.
